is an early (and in many ways a remarkably successful) attempt to represent the
relation between the pressure p, volume V and temperature T of a real gas. ( R, a
and b are constants for a given mass of the gas.) Find expressions for ( ∂p/∂V )T,
(∂V/∂T )p and (∂T/∂p)V, and verify that their product is −1.

Stationary values
14. The height h of each point (x,y) of an area of land is given by
h(x,y) = a(x+ y)
x2 + y2 + a2 ,
where a is a positive constant. Find the locations and heights of the highest and
lowest points of the terrain, and also those along the x and y axes. Sketch a map
of the region by showing contours of constant h in the (x,y) plane.
15. (i) Find the stationary points of the function
z = (x2 −y2) e−x2−y2

and y axes. Hence, or otherwise, determine the character of the stationary
points. Sketch the contours.

x2 + y2 = 1 of
(a)
xy2
(b)
e−xy
and the points at which they occur. Check your answers by applying the constraint
using the substitution x= cos θ, y= sin θ.

5Boltzmann distribution
21. Let
W =
N∏
s=1
(gs −1 + ns)!
(gs −1)! ns! (†)
and let the numbers ns be subject to the conditions
N∑
s=1
ns = n,
N∑
s=1
nsEs = E.
If both gs and ns are assumed to be large, so that Stirling’s approximation ln n! ≈
nln n−nmay be applied, show that ln W, considered as a function of the numbers
ns, is greatest when
ns = gs
[
eβ(Es−µ) −1
]−1
, (‡)
where β and −βµ are Lagrange multipliers.
Equation (‡) is in fact the Bose–Einstein distribution and follows from the formula
(†) which takes into account the eﬀects of quantum indistinguishability for bosons.
However you do not need to know any quantum mechanics to do this question!
For fermions the formula for W turns out to be
W =
N∏
s=1
gs!
ns! (gs −ns)! .
Find the value of ns for which this expression for W is maximized subject to the
same conditions. This is the Fermi–Dirac distribution.
22*. A ﬁnite container is ﬁlled with a monatomic ideal gas of constant internal energy
(total kinetic energy). It can be shown that the degeneracy of the kinetic energy
states is proportional to E1/2.
The number of particles n of kinetic energy E is therefore distributed as
n∝E1/2 e−βE−α,
where αand β are constants. Determine the most probable value and the expected
value of the kinetic energy of a molecule.
